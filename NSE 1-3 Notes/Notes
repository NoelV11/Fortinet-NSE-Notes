PII-Personal Identifiable Information
Botnets are set up using a Command and Control line
PASSWORD MANAGER-GENERATES RANDOM PASSWORDS
DO NOT USE THE SAME PASSWORD FOR ALL ACCOUNTS

Internet Threat Perspectives:-
Juice Jacking-MMalware installed to charging device, at public charge points, in public areas. 

Physical Security Awareness
Shoulder surfing-Watching passwords being entered over your shoulder
Follow company guidelines
Shred papers containing sensitive information

Cloud Security

Offers unlimited space
Allows organizations to run their services and applications on them
Virtualization-Ability for a master server, to distribute work to other servers connected to it, thus utilizing resources and reducing costs.

Types of clouds:-
IaaS=Infrastucture as a service-Service of renting out computer hardware, for organizations to run their applications and services in a virtualized manner
SaaS-Providing servers which allow running of applications, with managed services.
Provides Database Management
Complete application environment

Cloud vendor is responsible for ensuring the security of server infrastructure,but
Organization that installs the virtualization app on the server is responsible for securing access, network traffic, and data applications
Tools used by vendors and organizations, for security are the same.
Hybrid or multi cloud-Multiple servers, working over different vendors server architecture, with virtualized applications installed on it, by an organization, renting these

SD-WAN (Softtware Driven -Wide ..)
Optimal Application Performance
Reduced Costs
Consists of WAN Links, to connect services. If one link provides very little latency, the SD-WAN chooses another WAN link
Single Security Appliance
Led from use of a physical appliance to a virtual appliance providing security and reliability
It removed problems such as:-
Vendor services not integrating with organization services and other services
Handling of wiring by unqualified workers

Polymorphic Malware-A file of many malware, performing malicious activity
Signature-based malware cannot prevent this  ->Signature updates for the virus is done annually, monthly or quarterly ->Not effective
Security Antivirus has now specific signature to the polymorphic file
Heuristic Detection-Place the suspect file(containing malware), in a sandbox. Its actions are observed. If it shows suspect activity, it is flagged as malware. You can find new polymorphic types of malware
The news is then propagated to other security firms' threat intel service  -->Better than virus signature updates for each virus
Sandboxing is better than virus signature updates 

Security Orchestration and Automation
Increases efficiency
Reduces workloads
Automates manual processes 
Helps out in incident response
Uses a playbook (flow chart for the process to be performed)4
Blocks traffic from suspect IP'S
Phishing
Helps in the mitigation process, once an incident response is performed and information is gained
Teams can set alerts, on SOAR, for other teams. Eg - Once emails are determined to be phished, it sends alerts to analysts, alerting them of these phishing emails and taking action. Uses a phishing playbook.
Sending mails to other teams, reporting the action taken by SOAR

NAC-Network Access Control
Virtual Machine, controlling access to a network
NAC follows 802.xx IEEE standard
Consists of 3 parties- device wanting to connect, authenticator, the authentication server
Either block or provide access
NAC now covers guest access, BYOD, and IoT devices
IOT lack CPU space to cover securing software and other security tools
When MIS (Management Information Systems) introduces NAC, to a network, the following steps occur:-
NAC creates profiles for each device connected to the network
According to the profile, NAC allocates resources
Based on the profile, NAC provides access to the related server. Eg) Bank PC to Bank System Server
Complete visibility of networks

Sandbox-An environment, where processes are run, to check for malicious activities
Effective for zero-days vulnerability 
Sandbox contains OS, computer components etc, mimicking a computer, in a virtual environment
Failed to integrate with other devices on the network
Quarantines the zero-day vulnerability
If it finds something, the sandbox is affected, not the other components
Sandbox did not share threat intelligence information with other devices on network-time consuming

Second generation Sandbox devices
Shares threat intel data among devices(firewalls etc)

MITRE -Proposes ATT&CK Framework
Security devices implemented the framework
Shares security data with vendors, devices 

Security Information and Event Management
Analyzes security alerts in real-time, from servers, databases, virtual appliances, etc to a centralized environment
Run analytical tests on data collected->wateches out for IOC
Checks out user anomaly behavior
Uses ML

Disadvantage:-
Integration was tough
Regulatory Compliance -<Healthcare firms, bank firms not complying with HIPPA and PCI-DSS can be targets of attacks

     		Web Application Firewalls
WAF monitors HTTP protocol applications and websites
Next-generation WAF characteristics- Data Loss Prevention, DDOS Attacks, and IP Reputation
