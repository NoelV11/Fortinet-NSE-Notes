FORTINET 6.4

In this lesson, you will learn about FortiGate administration basics and the components within FortiGate that can be enabled to extend functionality. This lesson also includes details about how and where FortiGate fits into your existing network architecture.

Administration methods - GUI or command line
Login as admin
Create accounts for other users
Permissions for each user RW, RO NE, NW
Override idle timeout-Different for each user
Vdoms-Segregate admins with different powers
prof_admin admin type cannot view the password of superuser
Loggin in-2 methods - One way-Password
2 way-Password and RSA token from FortiToken sent to mobile

What happens if the password is lost?

Admin should get a snapshot of VM and restore configuration.
Temporary Account
Available on local console port and hard reboot
FortiGate must be physically switched off
Account Name =Maintainer Account,valid for 60s

Each Admin has a trusted IP
If admin logs from another device not having the trusted IP, access is blocked
Deafult trusted IP 0.0.0.0/0 <-Change this 

Override idle timeout-Different for each user
Override idle session for admin for inactivity session timeout - set using Override 
Use management protocols such as SSH, HTTPS, PING
PING exposes FortiGate to DOS attack
Ability to have both ipv4 and ipv6 - only responds to ipv6 pings

Hiding Features-Does do not disable features
Configured in Feature Visibility

Provide Aliases to IP Interfaces

A default gateway should be present for the FortiGate, in case FortiGate uses DHCP (Dynamic allocation of IP) or static method

Built-in Servers
FortiGate can use a DHCP server
Block MAC from receiving IP addresses
It can also allow-Assign
Reserve IP-Bind an IP to a MAC

DNS Server

Useful for FORTINET products using DNS Server-FortiMail

Fortigate answers DNS queries in 3 ways
Forward-Relay all DNS queries to DNS Server
Non-recursive-Replies to queries for items in FortiGate's DNS databases and does not forward unresolvable queries. Only uses Fortigate's DNS SErver
Recursive-                                                                         forwards.Sends unresolved queries to external DNS Servers

DNS database stores IP's for solving DNS queries

Backup configuration-Select backup destination
Save in either encrypted or non-encrypted(still hashes passwords) methods
File contains passwords of local and admin users
Option to secure backup with a password
Cannot be unlocked without a password and the same FortiGate model and firmware

Configuration File format
Same firmware and model is required 
If encrypted- model+firmware+pasword
unencrypted-model required
or upgrade model and firmware

Options to upgrade and downgrade features


All devices send log reports to FortiGate
If you serve as FabricRoot, you need to configure FortiAnalyzer IP Address
By adding the serial number of a device to the trusted list on FortiGate, the device connects and is a part o the Foti Security Fabric
Authorize the downstream FortiGate device on both root FortiGate and FortiAnalyxer

Once connected all details, messages, service is synced from upstream FortiGate device to downstream Fortigate device
Device identification processes in FortiGate
Agent Method--Mac address detection
HTTP Detection
TCP Fingerprint
The non-agent method-Device needs to send network traffic to FortiGate


FortiManage-Centralized management of all FortiGate devices
FortiMail
FortiWeb

Administrator defined workflows are called stitches
It is used to respond to events, in networks using if/if-then statements
Stitches-Allows to monitor network and take appropriate action when Security Fabric detects a threat

Compromised Host trigger can be enabled to automate threat response stitch
Checks for IOC 
Remedial Steps:-
Ban the IP
Quarantine the affected device
Only root users can remove banned IP 

External connectors allow you to integrate multi-cloud support such as ACI and AWS, within FortiGate 


Security Fabric Status widget
Blue- Connected to network
Grey-unauthorized devices connected to the network
Red-Not detected in the network but are recommended to be added to security fabric

Security Posture Widh=get-Gives rating of the security
Compare with other industries, organization
In percentile-Based on region, industry, etc
Must have valid security rating license


Security Rating divided into

Optimization
Security Posture and 
Fabric Coverage
Provides compliance recommendations, performance

Fortigate Firewall Policies

Traffic needs to match the protocol
ACCEPT/DENY traffic ->According to the firewall policy
Packets incoming should match with the  source and destination interface, as documented in the policy's interface criteria
Options to add a single source and destination interface. Options to have many or any interface is disabled on GUI
Users can be grouped into user groups
A user needs to be added as part of the source and is granted access, based on the firewall policy
Authentication Process- Login  Credentials
 -Users can specify the city, region, etc.
ISDB objects can be used as destinations in the firewall policy
Geographical addresses-IP's allocated to a country

Internet Service-Database that contains IP addresses, IP protocols used by common internet services. The database is downloaded periodically
Can be used as a source or destination, but not as both

Schedules-Add time element to policy
Perform Backup and other tasks
Recurring-Everyday
One Time-Pre specified start and end times

Another way to match policies with packet-Source and destination ports.Not reliable

Configuring Firewall Policies
Specify unique names for firewall policy. Easier to check.Performed on the command line
A UUID is generated fr each firewall object or policy

Security Profiles-Inspects each packet
Flow-based inspection
Proxy-based inspection

Generate logs for all IP sessions
One for the start of the session.One for end
The number of logs decreases performance

Traffic Shapers
Shared Policy shaping-Bandwidth management f security policies 
Per IP Shaping-                                 user IP addresses
Application control shaping


IPV4 and IPV6 are mixed into one.No need to maintain logs for both
For destination and source interfaces, you have to set ipv4 and ipv6 addresses for a policy
Both should match

Manage and Finetune firewall policies

Policy Usage-Last used, bytes transmitted, UUID, etc

FortiGate automatically assigns a policy ID when creating a new firewall policy on GUI

Simplify=-Group services
Object called Web-HTTP,HTTPS policies
FTP group-For FTP policies

Best Practices and Troubleshooting 

Certain characters are not supported while naming policies and passwords
Use underscores and hyphens for the policy name
Test policies in a maintenance window, before deployment
Security policies
Be careful while editing, adding, or deleting policies
POLICY ORDER SEQUENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT
check configuration settings before combining policies
Policy lookup feature-TO find a matching policy, based on input criteria

Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT is a process that allows a firewall/more rote to act as an agent between the internet or public network.NAT is used to preserve IP Addresses Done for
Improved Security, Amplification of Addresses
NAT and PAT-called NAPT translate internal private IP addresses to external IO addresses.
For outgoing connections-NAT option is a central SNAT, IP Pool and central SNAT table can be used and  is known as a source NAT
For incoming connections-Virtual IP'S and DNAT can be used and are known ad destination NAT

NAT64 and NAT 46-Allows ipv6 addressed hosts to communicate with ipv4 addresses hosts
NAT66-NAT between two ipv6 networks

Firewall policy Nat
SNAT and DNAT Need to be configured for all policies
SNAT uses outgoing interface address or configured IP pool
DNAT-Uses configured VIP as the destination address

Central NAT
SNAT and DNAT configurations are done as per the virtual domain
Applies to multiple firewall policies
SNAT is configured from the central SNAT policy
DNAT is configured from DNAT and VIP'S


Two ways to configure firewall policy SNAT
Using Outgoing Interface Address
Using Dynamic IP Pool

Source NAT uses egress interface address when NAT is enabled on the firewall policy

IP Pools define a single IP address /es to be used in a session. Configured in the same range as IP interface
The IP address in the interface should match with the IP's in the IP pool
4 types:-
Overload, One to one-Internal IP address is matched to the external address on a first-come-first-serve basisPAT is not required
, Fixed port range-Specify internal and external IP range and port block allocation-Type of PAT. External IP range should be specified, along with Block size and Block per user

The larger the IP's in the IP pool, the more the connections that can be established
Virtual IP'S Are DNAT objects
The default type is static NAT

By default firewall address objects does not match VIP'S
Default IP pool type-Overload
Default VIP type-Static-nat

Central NAT
Disabled by default
Enabled only on CLI-
Mandatory for New Generation Firewall policy type
A matching SNAT policy is required for all firewall policies
If matched, SNAT policy is matched on the firewall policy
If not, the session is opened using the original IP address
If there is no matching central SNAT policy or central SNAT policy configured-NAT will not be used in the firewall session
On FortiGate, VIP is selected as the destination address
As VIP is configured, a rule is created to allow DNAT
Disabling central NAT
Outgoing traffic SNAT will no longer be performed
DNAT and VIP's stop working

Session Helpers
Help to detect patterns of the same IP addresses on a layer
Create required secondary sessions and change application headers
The method used for advanced application tracking and control-Application Layer Gateway
Example of application layer gateway-VOIP Profile

Session Table-CLI Provides more info for the Session table than GUI
Gives info about max sessions
Sessions have TTL. If a process is idle and TTL reaches 0. process is deleted
Session Table has finite RAM
Diagnose sys session-Provides options to clear, filter, or show a list of sessions
system session list command-Get info about sessions

Best Practices and Troubleshooting
NAT Port Exhaustion-Inability of Fortigate to allocate NAT ports to new sessions
Remedies:-
HAVE LARGE IP pOOL WITH at least 1 external IP
Reduce sessions using NAT
Double-check start and end IP's of each IP Pool
Maintainance windows

Firewall Authentication

Verify source IP and device registered on Foregate-Not very secure
Login Credentials
Policies are custom for each device

Methods of authentication
Local Password-Simplest
Server Based-Stored on POP3, RADIUS, LDAP, and TACACS+ server   Only POP3 requires email domain as login credentials. Others use Login (Password+Username)
2FA 
Server Baed-Remote Based Authentication
Used when the same device needs to be validated by multiple Forti devices

2FA-Login Credentials + Certificate/Token/OTP
OTP is delivered through SMS and email-User contact details should be present with the user account-Usage of the NTP Server is recommended
The compromising account is more complex

The passive form of Authentication
Login is not needed -signs in transparently

Remote Authentication Servers

The LDAP protocol is used to maintain authentication data. A set of defined operations and a request and response network
The root of LDAP-Domain Component
Domain Component-DNS Server. Contains:-
Containers are objects that contain other objects similar to a folder in a file system-Example - country
Leaves-Objects at end of the branch.example-User ID

Command-diagnose test authserver ldap <servername> <username><password>-To test LDAP Query
Test before deployment

Radius -Provides auth, author, and accounting
When a user is authenticating, FortiGate sends an ACCESS-REQUEST packet to the RADIUS server. Reply from server will be:-
ACCESS-ACCEPT-User credentials are ok
       REJECT
ACCESS-CHALLENGE-RADIUS is asking for a secondary password ID or token. This is the reply, if the server uses 2FA

Command                           radius

User groups

Shared Relationship-Same department, organization
The policy can be specified separately for each group
4 group types:-
Firewall
Guest-Contain temporary accounts. Expire after a predefined amount of time. Used exclusively in wireless networks
FSSO-Fortinet Single Sign ON
RSSO-Radius

Authentication using Firewall Policies
Objects used by firewall policy for authentication
Local firewall accounts
External server accounts
PKI certificate users
FSSO Servers
The firewall policy should have a supported protocol. It is required for all types of authentication. Example-HTRP, FTP

3 ways to authenticate active authentication behavior

If you have an active authentication firewall policy, users don't need to authenticate. Uses fall-through policy
Auth on demand-Traffic won't be allowed until authentication is provided

Authenticate through Captive Portal
Captive Portal-Web users are authenticated using isername+password
Used to authenticate all users on a wireless/wired network
Enabled at the interface level
You v=can restrict CP to groups or allow for all

You can configure a firewall policy for suppressing captive portals for specific addresses or services. Useful for devices unable to authenticate, such as printers, fax machines.
When suppressed, traffic matching source or dest is not presented with CP login page
Can be configured on GUI

Customizing Portal Message-Using HTML

Authentication Timeout
Idle-No packets generated from host IP
Hard-Time is of value. The timer starts when the user is authentication and ends when the user logs out
New session-Timeout if no new sessions are created by the host device
 
Logging and Monitoring
3 types of logs
Traffic Logs-Forward-Traffic accepted/rejected according to firewall policy, Local-Contain info about traffic directly to and from FortiGate's management IP addresses. Also contain connections to GUI of FortiGaurd queries and Sniffer-Information related to traffic seen by one arm sniffer 
Event Logs-Logging administration management events.Subtypes-VPN, WAD,
Security Logs-Web Filter, User Anomaly. Subtypes are visible in GUI

Logs contain log levels-determine priority 0-ow 6-high
Logs contain:-

Header- Fields -Date and Time, LOG category, Subtype of Log VDOM
Body-Hostbname, Action was taken,msg-reason to take action,policy-Traffic matching firewall policy

Best Practices
Log activities required
logging activity matches network requirements
Have a backup logging plan

Local Logging-Storing logs on FortiGate hard drives
Logging to FortiGate hard drives-Called disk logging. It contains traffic and logs archives
75% of disk space is available to store logs
If the disk is full-Older logs are overwritten
First warning-75% Second-90% Third-95%

Remote Logging-Uses Syslog servers such as FortiCloud, FortiAnalyzer

Uploading Options of Logs 
Real-Time
Every minute
Every 5 minute
If FortiAnalyzer becomes unavailable to FortiGate, it uses the process to cache logs. Cached logs are sent to FortiAnalyzer
There is a maximum size to cache size
Local Traffic generates a huge load of logs

Reliable logging-Uses UDP 514 or TCP 514 port on FortiGate

Log Settings
Filtering-According to severity level, user traffic, namely traffic - Config in Command Line

Hide user names -Names appear as anonymous 

Log Backups-From database to a location
Using FTP, TFTP or USB -Stored in LZ4 formate
Backed up logs cannot be uploaded to another FortiGate device

Log Rolls-Lower space requirements

Why are certificates used by FortiGate?
Inspection
Privacy
Authentication
Provided by Certifying Authority
The certificate contains Subject and Subject Name=To distinguish certificates over each other
Standard Supported-X 509v3

Trust Tests  for Certificates
Check Revocation Lists-Check if cert has been revoked
Online Cert Status Protocol-
Check if the valid date and expiry date are between the current date

Digital Signature is generated for Certs

Certificate-based user auth uses an end entity cert to identify the user. Also uses the user's public key and signature of CA.


Use of SSL certificate by FortiGate-Not trusted by CA
Provides:-
Privacy of data
Identifies one or more users
Uses asymmetric and symmetric cryptography

Inspect Encrypted Data

No SSL Inspection-Viruses get around encrypted traffic
Certificate inspection-used to verify the identity of the webserver and ensure HTTPS protocol isn't used as a workaround to access sites you have blocked using web filtering
Featured to be applied using SSL Certificate Inspection-Web Filtering

TO perform full SSL Inspection, FortiGate must act as a CA
certificate issued by FortiGate should have a destination domain name-www.ex.ca

If multiple users are connecting to multiple servers and if the SSL cert is not trusted:=
Allow-Sends a trusted temp cert
Block
Ignore

Excepting sites from SSL inspection
For legal reasons
Because of traffic problems-Sites using HTTP public key pinning
Except them based on category(financial,healthcare),address

Invalid Certificate
Expired
Revoked
Validation Timeout
Validation Failed

If cert is invalid-either allowed, ignore, or block
Fortigate perform Cert chain validation based on CA Cert

We have the option to perform SSH deep scan on Multiple clients connecting to multi servers
SSH deep scans run on port 22-Proxy based scan

When doing a gull SSL inspection using FortiGate self-signed CA, the browser displays a message depicting a warning. Because it does not or trust the CA issuing the cert
To prevent this
Download Fortinet CA_SSL Cert
Use SSL cert issued by CA and install in necessary browsers
Ensure root CA is installed on browser/systems

Extension and value for cert validation cA=True

Ways to prevent MITM
HSTS-Strict transport security
HPKP-Public key pinning-Pins a public key to a specific browser

CSR-Cert signing request - Performed by file-based or Online SCEP method
Fortigate geenratues CSR
CSR is sign

SSL Cert issued by Private CA must be installed at endpoints


Web Filtering

Inspection Modes

Flow-COvers flow-based profiles
Faster scanning
Less resource required
Uses single direct filter approach pattern matching to identify and detect threats
Tools used by Proxy isn't available here
Proxy-More secure, allow both inspection modes security profiles, covers more profiles
Thorough inspection
More resources
Less false positives

Next-Generation Firewall policy-based modes
Profile based-Requires admins to create and use application control and web filter profiles and add them to the firewall. Applies to both flow and proxy
Policy-based-                                                                                               security policy
Applies only to the flow-based mode
Default-Flow 

FFortigAUrd Category Filter-Checks website category-Uses human resources and crawlers
Requires active contract
2 days grace period if not renewed
Elserating error will be given at all instances

Warning page before accessing a website-Interval to display message can be configured

Threat Feeds-Allows FG to dynamically import external block lists from  HTTP server-Contains cleartext URLs that should be blocked

Web Rating Override-Only allows URL's no wildcard characters

URL Filtering-Checks against entered websites in the list
Allow
Ignore
Block
Exempt

Contact FG for a better website rating or if not rated yet

Additional Proxy-based web filtering

Forti Quotas-Time to access categories that are set to monitor, warn or authenticate in web filter profile
Set a quota for users spending time on websites, based on category
Can be configured separately for each website
Resets after every midnight

File Filter-Inspects files traversing over HTTP and FTP protocols. Either allow or block or both

Web Profile Overrides-Applies to a user, user group, or Source IP. An override auth needs to be provided

Safe Search-Filter search results
Restrict Youtube Access
Web Content Filtering-Either exempt or block
Add characters, wildcards, or phrases to prevent websites from loading up these words
Max patterns that can be set-5000
Requires full deep SSL Scan, as FG needs to check packet headers

DNS Filtering
Lightweight
Lacks features offer by HTTTP Filtering
DNS is in cleartext

Allow, Redirect to Block Portal, Monitor

Application Control
Detects applications on a network
Check which takes up a lot of bandwidth
Either monitor, block or apply traffic shaping
Applications can use a different standard protocol
Uses IPS Engine
Report packets, with a predefined pattern of traffic/packet
Used Flow-based scan-Not applied by a proxy

Detecting Peer 2 peer apps
Hard to detect
Able to evade firewalls
Changing ports randomization
Changing encryption patterns

P2P Downloads
One client
Many servers (n)
Dynamic ports
Files are delivered 'n' times faster
Hard to block with traditional firewalls
A single peer can consume large amounts of bandwidth

Application Control Profile-Uses Flow-based scanning
3 filters:-
CategorieS-Similar apps are grouped, view app control signatures, configure settings, actions
Application Overrides-Configure actions for specific signatures or apps
Filter overrides-
Must be applied to a firewall policy/

Filter actions:_
Accept
Block
Monitor
Quarantine
If not sure-Select Monitor

NGFW Policy Mode
Available in Flow-based mode
Must specify SSH and SSL Security profile
ACCEPT or DENY actions for traffic- based on app control, groups policy
URL filter-Apps you add to policy should be a browser-based category
Apply antivirus and IPS security profiles to Accept

3 step process for NGFW Policy-based app filtering
1)AFortiOS will allow all traffic while forwarding packets to the IPS engine for inspection and identification of traffic.FortiOS creates an entry in the session table allowing traffic to pass and adds a may__dirty flag to it
2)As soon as the IPS engine identifies the app, it updates the session entry with the following information-dirty flag,ap_valid flag, and app id
3)Forti OS kernel performs a security policy lookup again to see if the identified app id is listed in any of the existing
security policies. This time the kernel uses both Layer 4 and 7 information for policy matching. After the criteria match the firewall policy rule, the FortiOS kernel applies the action configured on the security policy to the app traffic

Use rate limit to limit the bandwidth used by apps

Antivirus detection methods-MD5,CRRC,File Atrributes
Virus ology <vector>/<patern>
Antivirus Scanning Techniques

Antivirus Scanning-Can uses flow-based or proxy-based mode. Antivirus has two types of databases-extreme and extended. More optimized
Both modes use extended or extreme depending on CLI settings and IPS engine.
Flow based-Uses hybrid of scanning modes-legacy and default.IPS engine reads the payload of each packet, caches a local copy, and forwards it to the receiver. Consumes more PC Cycles than a proxy. When the receiver receives the last packet of the file, puts the packet on hold and sends a copy to the IPS engine.IPS enf=gine then extracts the payload and assembles the whole file and sends the file to the AntiVirus engine for scanning

Two courses of action:-
If a virus is detected, the last packet is dropped and the connection is reset
If an identical request is made, the block replacement is inserted immediately

Proxy inspection mode-Each protocol's proxy picks a connection, buffers the entire file, before scanning. If a virus is detected, a block replacement mage is displayed. Long time to scan

Two types of additional AV scanning modes-MAPI and CDR
Files bigger than buffer size are not scanned
More configurable

Default mode enhances scanning of nested archive files, without buffering container archive file
Legacy mode-Buffers full container and scans it
Greyware Scanning-Software installed without the user's knowledge. Can have side effects and is not exactly a virus
Heuristic-Raise probability of a virus.More false positive.Can find zero-day vuln.Can be enabled on CLI.Uses more resources
Two actions for heuristic scanning
pass-Detected files will be passed by FG and record an event log
block-                      blocked
Order of scanning=AV, GS, and HS
A more certain way for detection-Sandbox.
Less false positives
Less usage of resources

Content Disarm and Reconstruction-Removes exploitable content and replaces it with content, known to be safe.
The recipient is not at risk
CDR supported protocols-POP3,SMTP,HTTP
After replacement, traffic flows as usual

Virus Outbreak Prevention-Quick virus outbreaks can infect a network before signatures can be developed to stop them. Outbreak protection stops these virus outbreaks before signatures become available on FG

FG uses hash-based detection for new threats, not yet detected by antivirus signatures.
Scanned by scan unit daemon

Malware block list
Hosted on the webserver
Accessible by HTTP, POP3
May contain MD5, SHA256 hashes

Intrusion Prevention and DOS

Difference between Anomaly and Exploit
Exploit-Attack with a known pattern.Matched by IPS, WAF
Anomaly-Unusual behavior.Example-High CPU Usage. Detected and mitigated. Detected by behavior analysis such as DOS Analysis, rated based IPS Signatures

IPS on FG, use signature databases to detect know attacks
Web Filtering

Hoe?
Decoders arse each packet, according to port spec.

FG IPS service updates the signatures.IPS Signatures are updated on FG, to stay alert against the new exploit. Updation is crucial

IPS Sig database id divided into:-

Regular-Causes rare or no false positives.Smaller database.Default action->block detected  attack
Extended-Contains several sig for attacks that cause significant performance impact or do not support blocking due to its nature.Not present in regular FG devices, due to its; large size

Monitor feature of IPS-Allows traffic and logs activity

DOS

Attacks that exploit asymmetric processing or bandwidth between clients and servers
To block a DOS attack-Apply DOS policy on devices

Types of DOS Attacks
1)TCP SYN -Same method for TCP scan
Malicious clients continue to send more SYN Packets, half opening more connections, until the server's connection table becomes full. It can no longer accept new clients

2)ICMP Sweep-We know  ICMP MITM

3)TCP port scan

4)Distributed DOS-Botnet

4 types of anomaly detection protocol
Flood sensor-Detctes high volume of specific protocol or signal in protocol
Sweep Scan-Probe by Port Scan
Source Sig-Checks for a large volume of traffic originating from single IP
Destination Sig-Look for large volumes destined for single IP
At first attempt of setting DOS-Set it to log, not block.Since blocking can block all devices on the network

WAF
Attractive to attackers
WAF protects a server
A server receives requests from clients
Only available in proxy inspection mode
Example-XSS, SQL Injection

SSL VPN
Easy way to give remote users access to your network

Two modes to access SSL-VPN
1)Tunnel-Supports more protocols
Requires installation of VPN Client/Adapter. You need a BPN only client
Connect to FG, using FortiClietnt
Any IP network app running on a client can send traffic through the tunnel
VPN SOftware client needs admin privileges. More software
Connect to SSLVPN through SSL-VPN client
Provide credentials

Also supports split tunneling
If enabled-Egress firewall policy is required
Reduces bottlenecks


2)Web mode-Only requires a browser and supports a few protocols
